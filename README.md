Features, libraries and frameworks

    .NET Framework 4.7
    PostSharp [I just can't have a project without it]
    ASP.NET Identity 2.2.1
    AutoMapper 6.1.1
    ASP.NET Default headers removed
    bootstrap 3.3.7
    DocumentFormat.OpenXml
    elmah.corelibrary 1.2.2
    Elmah.Mvc 2.1.2
    EntityFramework 6.1.3
    jGrowl
    jQuery
    jQuery.UI.Combined
    jQuery.Validation
    Select2
    knockoutjs
    Knockout.Validation
    knockout-select2
    LinqKit
    Moment.js
    NumeralJS 
    Z.EntityFramework.Extensions (project from a good friend of mine with a lot of extensions)
    Many more... 

Some libraries (like knockoutJS or AutoMapper) are not mandatory.

PostSharp, in the other hand, is mandatory. If it's repetitive, it can be automated and I personally can't have a project without it and you should also have it. I'm saving more than 5k lines of code in a small project  just by using it. You can use the essentials version if you want to or apply for a full lifetime edition for free at https://www.postsharp.net/purchase/discounts

I accept suggestions and recommendations.
